# Data-Free Model Pruning at Initialization via Expanders

This respository contains the code and experiments for the paper "Data-Free Model Pruning at Initialization via Expanders", appearing at the Efficient Deep Learning for Computer Vision CVPR Workshop, 2023.

Authors: James Stewart, Umberto Michieli, and Mete Ozay.

## Requirements and installation

A list of requirements for this project can be found in ```environment.yml```. 

To create and activate a conda environment from these requirements, run ```conda env create -f environment.yml``` and ```conda activate config_model_env```.

## Architectures

We provide support for fully-connected and sparsified versions of VGG 16 and ResNet (depth 18, 32, 50, 101, and 152). Their implementations can be found in ```src/model_factory/models```.

Implementations of other models should be placed here, and added to ```src/model_factory/model_factory.py```. The list of supported models found in ```src/utils/config.py``` should also be updated.

## Datasets

We provide support for the CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. In the former case, the data will be downloaded to ```data/```; in the latter case, the data should be placed here. The Tiny ImageNet dataset can be downloaded from ```http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip```.
After downloading it, run the script ```data/prepare_tiny_imagenet.py``` to prepare the data.

To add a new dataset, a custom data loader should be implemented according to the interface specified by ```src/data_loader_factory/data_loaders/data_loader.py```. The list of supported datasets found in ```src/utils/config.py``` should also be updated.

## Graph models

We implement sparse convolutional and linear layers according to three different random graph models: a random graph (Random), a random regular graph (RReg), and a random left-regular graph (XNet). The implementations of these graph masked layers can be found in ```src/model_factory/layers```.

New graph models should be implemented in ```src/graph_factory/graph_utils.py``` and added to ```src/graph_factory/graph_factory.py```. The architecture to be sparsified according to the new graph model may then be added to the model factory, as per the above instructions. 

## Getting started

After installing the requirements, running the command ```main.py --model='vgg16bn' --dataset='cifar10'``` from ```src/``` will train and test a fully-connected VGG 16 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset for 300 epochs using the defauly hyperparameters. We can sparsify this model using random graphs of average degree 3 by running ```main.py --model='vgg16bn_random' --degree=3 --dataset='cifar10'```. For all other options and information on the default hyperparameters, see ```src/arg_parser/arg_parser.py```.

## Experiments

To reproduce the results for VGG 16 and ResNet on both CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet, we provide a number of scripts located in ```scripts/```. From the ```src/``` folder, simply run ```bash ../scripts/[script name]``` to execute each of these. The console logs will be written to ```outputs/```.
